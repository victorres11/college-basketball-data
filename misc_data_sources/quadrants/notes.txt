Example URL's: https://bballnet.com/teams/michigan-state, https://bballnet.com/teams/oregon


The python script in this page I think can reliably pull this data.

What I'd like to be include in the json data (along with all the other data that is generated) is the data that allows me to ouput these two items:

Wins by quadrant
Quad 1: Record: 0-2
Quad 2: Record: 0-1
Quad 3: Record: 2-0
Quad 4: Record: 2-0

Quadrant Win Opponents:
Quad 1: [ucla, michigan_state, usc]
Quad 2: [nevada, elon]
Quad 3: []
Quad 4: []
